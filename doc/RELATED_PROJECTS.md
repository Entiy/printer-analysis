### foomatic

Foomatic is a database-driven system for integrating free software printer drivers with common spoolers under Unix.

http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting/database/foomatic

four sub-projects:

* foomatic-filters
The universal print filter "foomatic-rip", used by spoolers to convert PostScript job data into the printer's native format as described by a printer/driver-specific PPD file.

* foomatic-db-engine
Foomatic's database engine generates PPD files from the data in Foomatic's XML database. It also contains scripts to directly configure print queues and handle jobs.

* foomatic-db
The collected knowledge about printers, drivers, and driver options in XML files, used by foomatic-db-engine to generate PPD files. It also contains manufacturer-supplied PPD files which got released under free software licenses.

* foomatic-db-nonfree
Foomatic database extension consisting of manufacturer-supplied PPD files released under non-free licenses which restricts them in how they can get redistributed.

### cups-filters

This project provides backends, filters, and other software that was once part of the core CUPS distribution but is no longer maintained by Apple Inc.

From CUPS 1.6.0 on, this package is required for using printer drivers with CUPS under Linux. With CUPS 1.5.x and earlier this package can be used optionally to switch over to PDF-based printing.

### CUPS

CUPS is the standards-based, open source printing system developed by Apple Inc. for OS X? and other UNIX?-like operating systems. CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) to support printing to local and network printers.
